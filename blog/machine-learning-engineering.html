<div class="card container">
  <p>Check for details in <a href="../wiki.html">the wiki</a>.</p>
  <p>Mainly developed from the perspective of supervised learning.</p>

<div class="card container">
	<h3>Data</h3>
  <p>Validate the integrity of the training dataset.</p>
  <h4>Accuracy and Consistency</h4>
  <p>Errors in the data limits model performance and can be corrected or filtered out.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Input feature errors</li>
    <li>Label errors</li>
    <li>Inconsistency in the labeling</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Inconsistent or unreliable data can be mapped to a new class for identifying uncertainty. At least the model will know it doesn't know!</p>
  <h4>Representative Training Data</h4>
  <p>Training data should contain input and output that are proportional to the population.</p>
  <p>Models will optimize themselves to the training data and be sub-optimal when run on the true population.</p>
  <h4>Imbalanced Data</h4>
  <p>Outliers in a regression problem or a small portion of one or more classes in a classification problem.</p>
  <p>Can cause performance issues on classes.</p>
  <p>Solutions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Upsampling</li>
    <li>Downsampling (with bagging is an option)</li>
    <li>Value minority data more while training model</li>
    <li>Convert regression output to categorical pdf, show chances of an outlier</li>
  </ul>
</div>

  <h3>Feature Engineering</h3>
  <h4>Numeric</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Scale</li>
    <li>Bin and convert to categorical</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Categorical</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>One hot Encoded</li>
    <li>Hashed Feature</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Can be converted to new features through embeddings or crossing</p>
  <h4>Array</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Convert to set of features</li>
    <li>Take bulk statistics</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Processing complex features</h4>
  <p>Usually best to feed into a specialized model which returns an embedding</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Text</li>
    <li>Images</li>
    <li>Videos</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Model Output</h3>
  <p>First choosing what to model is important. Make sure what you are predicting is the best available target for the service you want to provide.</p>
  <p>Then make sure the output type of the model is the best way to represent the target you're predicting. Obviously standard Regression and Classification outputs are an option.</p>
  <h4>Regression</h4>
  <p>Use a sigmoid function to restrict regression output within a range.</p>
  <h4>Multinomial Classification</h4>
  <p>Represent a range of values as a set of classes. The set of classes will represent a binned probability distribution function and can be more informative than a single regression value but will have less precision since each category represents a range.</p>
  <p>Resize the number of classes to be more broad if necessary. Performance can be improved at the loss of precision.</p>
  <h4>Multilabel Classification</h4>
  <p>Tagging multiple categories per input can often be very useful.</p>
  <p>Training multilabel classification models can be difficult. The dataset needs to have a examples of each class without too much correlation between any two classes. Thresholds need to be tuned and evaluated for each class.</p>
  <p>A single multilabel classification model can be replaced with a collection of binary classification models, one for each category. This can increase performance by giving the models simpler problems but creates more complexity by having to train and manage multiple models.</p>
  <h4>Multitask Output</h4>
  <p>One model with multiple output types.</p>
  <p>Only one model simplifies maintainence and multiple outputs can help generalize a powerful model preventing it from overfitting. It's not always an option depending on the model.</p>
</div>

<div class="card container">
  <h3>Model Types</h3>
  <p>Selecting the type of model to train usually depends on some combination of the following factors:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Implementation difficulty and maintainence</li>
    <li>Interpretability</li>
    <li>Training speed</li>
    <li>Inference speed</li>
    <li>Hosting resources needed</li>
    <li>Problem complexity</li>
    <li>Amount of training data</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Bias, Variance, and Data</h4>
  <p>Complex problems need more powerful models to understand them. But more powerful models also need more data to counter the high variance (see bias-variance tradeoff) associated with powerful models.</p>
  <p>Not enough data?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Break down the problem into a set of simpler problems</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Cascade Ensemble</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Apply boosting or bagging to high bias models</li>
    <li>Apply regularization to a high variance model</li>
    <li>Use domain knowledge to create high bias models with high performance</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Generative Models</li>
      <li>Bayesian Models</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h4>Common Models</h4>
  <p>TO DO</p>
  <h4>Boosting, Bagging, and Stacking</h4>
  <p>All can be used to help boost performance at the cost of creating and managing extra models.</p>
  <h5>Boosting</h5>
  <p>Cannot be easily integrated into a pipeline as an afterthought.</p>
  <p>Model training needs to be does serially.</p>
  <p>Inference can be done in parallel.</p>
  <p>Often provides the best performance out of the other ensemble methods.</p>
  <h5>Bagging</h5>
  <p>Easy to implement or add to a pipeline.</p>
  <p>Training can be done in parallel.</p>
  <p>Inference can be done in parallel.</p>
  <p>Models often do not cover each others weaknesses as well.</p>
  <h5>Stacking</h5>
  <p>Easy to implement or add to a pipeline.</p>
  <p>Training and inference can only be done serially.</p>
