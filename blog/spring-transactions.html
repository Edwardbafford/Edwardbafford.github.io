	<p>The Spring Transactional annotation is used to manage database transactions with respect to Java methods.</p>
	<h4>Pitfalls!</h4>
	<p>Transactional methods need to be public and called externally or the transaction will not be created. Enable the transactional logs in order to monitor the creation and committing of transactions if necessary.</p>
	<h4>Design Pattern</h4>
	<p>The service layer of a web application should control all the high level business logic which coordinates with DAO and Manager objects.</p>
	<p>Manager and DAO objects when needed can have Transactional methods which are public and called by other higher level objects.</p>
	<p>The idea is that higher and lower level logic should not be contained within one object because the lower level transactional methods will not work if they are called within the same object!</p>
