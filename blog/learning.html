  <h2>My Self-Learning Process</h2>

<div class="card container">
  <h4>Topics</h4>
  <p>I started by deciding on a list of topics of I'm interesting in learning. For me this is - Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Science, Application Development, Data Enginering, Statistics, Probability, and Optimization.</p>
  <p>Next using the topics as a guide, I find quality resources that I would eventually like to study. These are usually either online PDFs or Books.</p>
  <p>Finally, I order the reading resources into a list based on my interest level. I often update and reorder this list as my interests change.</p>
  <h4>Reading</h4>
  <p>I begin reading resources from the list in order. I often split between two resources alternating chapters so that I'm never stuck on one topic for months.</p>
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>As I read each chapter I take notes in an Ipad. Once the chapter is complete I review the notes and formalize them into a personal wiki which I have stored on github and is accessible through the internet (you're on the blog section right now). The personal wiki tool I use it <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a> but I'm sure there are other good options.</p>
  <p>The purpose of the wiki is to have my own distilled ideas which I can reference.</p>
  <h4>Studying</h4>
  <p>While the reading and note taking process is going on I also like to review older topics that are stored in my wiki. I start by choosing an older and stable section of the wiki to review and load the concepts into a flashcard app. Currently I'm using a mobile app called Quizlet.</p>
  <p>Flashcards (or recall learning) has been shown to be one of the most effective ways to remember information. The wiki is always there for detailed reference but it is the studying that allows me to retain and leverage the things I've learned.</p>
