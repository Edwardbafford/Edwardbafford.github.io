    I don't go into detail about any of the concepts here. Check my wiki for details about concepts mentioned here.

	<h3>Software development process</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Break down applications into smaller services to make security management easier</li>
    <li>Incorporate security into the code review process</li>
    <li>Use linters to discover vulnerabilities</li>
    <li>Continously test previously discovered vulnerabilities (regression testing)</li>
    <li>Continously search for bugs using an internal team, bug bounty programs, or third party teams</li>
    <li>Prioritize security issues using a security ranking system, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerability_Scoring_System">CVSS</a> is a standard system</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
  <p>Use an encrypted protocol such as HTTPS to communication between machines. This prevents man in the middle attacks.</p>
  <h4>Don't trust be default</h4>
  <p>The principle is to setup the system in such a way that nothing is authorized by default and must be explicitly provisioned</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use whitelists over blacklists - as things change blacklists get outdated</li>
    <li>Block ports by default - only the systems you are aware of can be reach externally</li>
    <li>Only give systems access to the OS in ways they need - limits damage of a compromised system</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h3>Application Design</h3>
  <h4>Passwords</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Enforce high entropy passwords - harder to brute force hack</li>
    <li>Save a hashed form of credentials, for authorization hash with the same algorithm and see if the hashed forms match - this prevents anyone from being able to steal user credentials</li>
    <li>Offer multi-factor authentication</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>CSRF</h4>
  <p>GET requests shouldn't change the state of the application because GET requests can easily and accidentally be made by users.</p>
  <p>Have the application check the origin of the requests and reject untrusted sources.</p>
  <p>Use CSRF tokens to ensure the user has been using the application.</p>
  <h4>Regex DoS</h4>
  <p>Check regex statements with regex linters to prevent poor performing regex.</p>
  <p>Don't allow users to inject their own regex.</p>
  <h4>General DoS</h4>
  <p>Log requests and high level processes in order to determine bottlenecks and if any aspect of the system is being exploited.</p>
  <h4>XSS</h4>
  <p>Ensure that user supplied data that is injected into the DOM and is interpretted as text. Linters can help with this.</p>
  <h4>XXE</h4>
  <p>Disable external entity setting in XML parsers.</p>
  <p>Use JSON! It's better anyway...</p>
  <h4>SQL Injection</h4>
  <p>Use prepared statements.</p>
