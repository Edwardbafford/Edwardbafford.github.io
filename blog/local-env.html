  <p>My best practices for organizing your computer while developing software projects.</p>

  <h4>Projects</h4>
  <p>Compartmentalize each project as much as possible within a single directory.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Code base (obviously)</li>
    <li>Dedicated web server instance</li>
    <li>Dedicated data base instance</li>
	<li>Any other dependency instances should also be single dedicated instances... queue, downstream application, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I think in general it is uncommon to have a single instance of dependent software dedicated to each project. For example, if you have multiple projects which use MySQL you usually only have one instance of MySQL running.</p>
  <p>I know its not always possible or worth it to do this but having dedicated instances of all dependencies avoids issues of interference between projects. This could happen with respect to the version of the dependency, the configuration of the dependency, and probably other ways I'm not aware of.</p>  
  <p>If possible I think it's best to have simple ways to start/stop all components of a project as needed. Containers are a great way of doing this!</p>
	
  <h4>Utilities</h4>
  <p>Helper applications are fine to be installed and used globally.</p>
  <p>For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>IDEs</li>
    <li>Notepad++</li>
	<li>Postman</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The reason for this is that these tools are simply used for viewing and editing your projects, there is no way for projects to interfere with each other through these tools.</p>

  <h4>Metadata</h4>
  <p>Any information related to your projects should ideally be synced with some sort of external server. Examples of this are something like OneDrive and password storage systems.</p>
  <p>Along with your code base, backing up project metadata secures it in case anything is deleted or lost locally.</p>
