  <p>Some quick definitions for digital information metrics.</p>

  <h4>Bit</h4>
  <p>Let's start off simple, a bit is the most basic unit of digital information, which is represented by a single binary value, a one or a zero.</p>
  <h4>Byte</h4>
  <p>Okay, next a byte is a series of 8 bits. Simple enough!</p>
  <h4>Kilobit (kb)</h4>
  <p>A kilobit is 1000 bits.</p>
  <h4>Kilobyte (kB)</h4>
  <p>A kilobyte is 1000 bytes making it 8 times larger than a kilobit.</p>
  <p>Kilobytes and Kilobits follow the standard metric patterns where kilo is 1000, mega is 1000000, giga is 1000000000 and so on...</p> 	
  <h4>Kibibyte</h4>
  <p>Now, Kibibyte is the weird one.. it represents 1024 bytes. It's close to 1000 and therefore close to a kilo but it can be represented by 2 to the power of 10. The 2 to the 10th thing I suppose lines up nicely with digital hardware or something? I don't know but Kibibytes are more commonly used than Kilobytes in computers and are abbreviated as kiB or KB.</p>
  <p>Following the metric pattern a mebibyte is 1024 x 1024 bytes, a gebibyte is 1024 x 1024 x 1024 bytes, etc. The abbreviation patterns are kept as well miB/MB, giB/GB, etc.</p>
