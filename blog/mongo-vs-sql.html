  <h2>Using MongoDb vs SQL</h2>
</div>


<div class="card container">
	<h3>MongDb</h3>
    <p>MongoDb and other document based databases have a couple advantages over standard SQL Databases.</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>No schema is required, you essentially dump json objects into various buckets</li>
    	<li>Becuase documents don't reference each other (no foreign keys) the database can easily be spread over a cluster and therefore scales extremely well</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Essentially MongoDb is very useful for storing messy, large, text based objects while maintaining the ability to query and update them.</p>
    <br/>
    <h3>SQL Databases</h3>
    <p>Standard SQL databases are excellent for modeling data and storing/querying it quickly. The tightly knit data model allows you to easily and quickly traverse through your system and read/update as necessary. The downside is that it's nearly impossible to scale a database like this while retaining it's integrity.</p>
    <br/>
    <h3>Combining Them?</h3>
    <h5>Disclaimer! I have not tried this in a project... yet</h5>
    <p>I think using just MongoDb is almost never the best solution. In almost any application you will have data that is interconnected and therefore should be stored in a tradition SQL database. I think the best approach is to store your non-text data in a SQL database then store large messy sections of text data in a MongoDb so you don't need to worry about a schema and don't have to worry about your performance as the size of the database increases. Entries of the SQL database can reference the MongoDb documents by id as needed.</p>
